title: v2.2.1 (latest)
---

```note
Containers have the same major.minor number, such as 2.2.x. 
Bug fixes are applied to the containers that changed. For example, psql-app
may be 2.2.1 while postgres is 2.2.0.
``` 

# v2.2.1 Fixes:

* Fixed issue with global IP rib not updating new/first seen prefixes.
  This caused an issue for new peer RIB dumps and when there are new
  prefixes added over time. 
* Added new ```sync_global_ip_rib()``` function. This function can be used
  to refresh/sync the entire global RIB. **THIS CAN TAKE A WHILE TO RUN** 

> **Containers Updated**
> * psql-app - Container will upgrade schema from 2.2.0
 

# v2.2.0 Changes:

* Major performance increase for IP rib inserts/updates.
  A major factor in disk IOPS is related to 
  updating attributes and RIB entries at the same time. This
  in effect duplicates the mount of updates for every NLRI.
  This was not efficient and caused twice as much load on the
  disk when it didn't need to. The ```psql-app``` consumer now
  caches the state of a base_attr hash ID so that it can
  skip updating a hash_id that was already processed. In
  memory cache will auto expire hash_id's processed
  if there are no updates within 20 minutes.

* Changed the ```openbmp/postgres``` container to use
  [TimescaleDB-HA](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker-ha) in order to 
  support HA and add the much needed [PostGIS](https://postgis.net) and
  [PGRouting](https://pgrouting.org/). Together these extensions enable better
  analytics and the ability to calcuate shortest paths (e.g., Dijkstra)
  on link-state, BGP as-paths, best paths based on quality, etc. 

* Renamed ```psql-app``` container script ```/usr/local/openbmp/dbip-to-psql.py``` to
  ```/usr/local/openbmp/geo-csv-to-psql.py```.  Added MaxMind City CSV import to the
  import script.  DB-IP or MaxMind CSV files can be imported now.

* Add DB-IP cron job to automatically load [DB-IP] 

* Reworked ```update_global_ip()``` to improve
  performance on global rip updates.  Global
  RIB update will now detect last time it was run
  in order to resume based on that instead of fixed interval.
  Max length of time to go back is 4 hours
  by default. The first param now identifies this value.

* Removed ```prefix_bits``` column from ```ip_rib```. It is no longer needed
  with GIN prefix indexing. This field was wasting space
  and slowing down inserts.

* Removed partitioning on base_attrs and ip_rib
  as it did not improve performance.

* Adjusted base_attrs auto vacuum settings. Auto vacuum is something 
  that will need to be tuned in order to avoid it consuming too
  much disk IOPS/throughput.

* Tuned ```psql-app``` default config to use 4 consumers,
  max writers per thread type defaults to 4.

* Switched HASH indexes to BTREE. Hash indexes
  were performing worse even with equal join/queries.

* Added prefix BTREE index for better equal
  ```ip_rib``` queries

* Fixed ```psql-app``` container **ENABLE_RPKI** and **ENABLE_IRR** to
  only enable if the value is 1.  Previously defining the variable
  with any value would enable the feature.

* Added **ENABLE_DBIP** to enable DB-IP geo data import once a month.
  DB-IP will be imported only once a month and whenever the container
  is restarted.

* Changed IRR import script to import only RADb considering RADb mirrors the others

# Geo Coding Import
The 2.2.0 update includes DB-IP auto import script. The import will run only if ```ENABLE_DBIP=1```.  When
enabled, it will run each time the container is restarted and thereafter once a month.  In order to prevent mass downloads,
the cron job will randomize the hour and minute that the script is run. 

# Upgrade

```danger
If you haven't upgraded to 2.1.x yet, you will need to follow the 
[Fresh Upgrade](/install_config/fresh_upgrade.html) instructions.  
```

## Upgrade Options
It is possible to upgrade from 2.1.x, but if data can be purged, the recommendation is to perform a fresh DB upgrade
by following the [Fresh Upgrade](/install_config/fresh_upgrade.html) instructions. 

### Upgrade from 2.2.0

1. Update docker-compose by either downloading the latest or edit it manually. If you edit it manually,
   all you have to do is update the version of the ```psql-app``` to ```image: openbmp/psql-app:2.2.1```

2. Run docker compose up again to recreate the container.  The container will upgrade the schema. 

```
OBMP_DATA_ROOT=${OBMP_DATA_ROOT} docker-compose -p obmp up -d
```

The global IP RIB could be missing prefixes when initial RIB dumps are out of sync with the global rib cron job. The
```sync_global_ip_rib()``` function can be used to sync the global rib.  The function can take a while to run and
will cause a lot of extra disk IOPS. It is recommended to run it after initial RIB dumps.

Run ```select sync_global_ip_rib();``` to synchronize the global IP RIB table.

### Upgrading from 2.1.x
```warning
Only supported for  2.1.0 or greater
```

1. Set the data root
  ```
  export OBMP_DATA_ROOT=/var/openbmp
  ```

2. Update postgres file owner/uid
[timescaledb-ha](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker-ha) sets the postgres user to use uid ```1000```, which
is different than the previous container.  You **MUST** fix the permissions before starting the container.  Run the
below to fix permissions. 

```
sudo chown -R 1000 ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/
sudo chown -R 1000 ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/data
sudo chown -R 1000 ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/ts
```

3. update postgres.conf
The new container has some minor changes.  Run the below to update the existing configuration. 

```
export PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Seattle/O=OpenBMP/CN=localhost"  \
        -keyout ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/data/psql_server.key -out ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/data/psql_server.crt -days 2048 \

sed -i -e "s/^\#*ssl_cert_file.*=.*/ssl_cert_file =  '${PGDATA//\//\\\/}\/psql_server.crt'/" ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/data/postgresql.conf
sed -i -e "s/^\#*ssl_key_file.*=.*/ssl_key_file =  '${PGDATA//\//\\\/}\/psql_server.key'/" ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/data/postgresql.conf
sed -i -e "s/^shared_preload_libraries.*/shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb,pg_cron'/g" ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/postgres/data/postgresql.conf
```

4. Upgrade Grafana by copying over the latest provisioning data

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/OpenBMP/obmp-grafana.git
    # OR git pull

    cp -r obmp-grafana/dashboards obmp-grafana/provisioning ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/grafana/
    sudo chmod o+rx -R ${OBMP_DATA_ROOT}/grafana/
   
    docker restart obmp-grafana
    ```

    > Make sure the files copied are owned by the container user. If not, provisioning will not load.

5. Upgrade docker compose file to include the latest versions

    ```
    # Get latest compose file  - Your previous file will be saved as docker-compose.yml.<N>
    wget --backups=3 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBMP/obmp-docker/main/docker-compose.yml  
    ```

6. Update the docker-compose.yml file variables and volumes based on your previous compose file.
    You can use ```diff``` to see the differences that need to be merged/updated.
    ```diff -u docker-compose.yml.1 docker-compose.yml```

7. Run docker compose to recreate the containers

    ```
    OBMP_DATA_ROOT=${OBMP_DATA_ROOT} docker-compose -p obmp up -d
    ```

8. Apply postgres run-time changes
Run the below after postgres is up and running/accepting connections.  If you get
```
FATAL:  the database system is starting up
```

try again later. 


```
docker exec -it obmp-psql-app bash

# Run the below once in the container
source /usr/local/openbmp/pg_profile

psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis CASCADE;" $POSTGRES_DB
psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgrouting CASCADE;" $POSTGRES_DB
psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -c "ALTER EXTENSION timescaledb UPDATE;" $POSTGRES_DB
psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -c "ALTER EXTENSION pg_cron UPDATE;" $POSTGRES_DB

```
