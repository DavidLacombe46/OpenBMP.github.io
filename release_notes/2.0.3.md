# Changes:

* Log4j security fixes by upgrading to 2.17.1
* Upgrades all components and libraries to current versions as of Jan-2022
* Various bug fixes
* Schema changes to improve performance
* AS_PATH and communities are now Postgres arrays with indexing.  This improves
  performance over using regexp.  The improvement deprecates the as_path_analysis and
  gen_asn_stats tables
* TimescaleDB compression has been added to many tables to improve disk usage
* Retention control has been moved from cron to timescaleDB job process. Retention should now
  be changed via the retention policies.  Status of the jobs can be monitored via
  timescaleDB job status.  See https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/data-retention/ for more details.
* global_ip_rib table has been improved to support updates every 5 minutes
* RPKI validator deprecated and replaced with URL based downloads
* PeeringDB integration


## Upgrade

Manually merging the PSQL schema changes is possible, but it is not currently automated.
Unfortunately there are several changes to the schema that make
it difficult to update.  For example, converting from string AS_PATH to array AS_PATH.   For this reason,
it is recommended that you perform a wipe and fresh install.  Future versions should support
auto merge/upgrades operations. 

See [Fresh Upgrade](/install_config/fresh_upgrade.md) for details on how to upgrade by doing a fresh install.
